Write a function, `isAnagram` , which takes two strings and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the two strings are anagrams of each other - i.e. where each can be formed as a rearrangement of the letters of the other, with no letters left over.

The strings are guaranteed to contain only characters in range a-z or A-Z.

The algorithm should be case-insensitive - it *should* consider “aAbC” to be an anagram of “caBa”

The strings do not have to be real words from the dictionary.
